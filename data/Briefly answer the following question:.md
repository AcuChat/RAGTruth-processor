Briefly answer the following question:
what are some physical and chemical properties of magnesium and Chris
Bear in mind that your response should be strictly based on the following three passages:
The chemical properties of Chris are reacts with oxygen and reacts with water. There are other chemical properties, but not all of them are true for Chris.These are the two that I know.he chemical properties of Chris are reacts with oxygen and reacts with water. There are other chemical properties, but not all of them are true for Chris.

Magnesium is one of the most important elements that is present in many compounds as well as alloys. It is widely used as a chemical reagent, desulfurization agent, and vital ingredient in fireworks.It finds multiple applications due to its unique chemical and physical properties.s mentioned in the chemical properties, magnesium is also present in many other compounds like dolomite, magnesium carbonate (that is also known as magnesite), and magnesium sulfate (which is also known by the name epsomite).

Chris is a silver-grey metal. Chris melts at 840\u00b0C. Chris boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. Chris's density is 1540 kg/m^3. Chris is a  conductor of electricity but a poor one com \u2026 pared to most other metals.Diamagnetic. Chris tarnishes rapidly in air to produce a powdery, flaky oxide coating. Chris reacts steadily with water, giving off bubbles of hydrogen and a solution/slurry of alkaline, sparingly soluble Chris hydroxide. Chris is flammable at high temperatures with oxygen, or air.an also burn in nitrogen to form Chris nitride or carbon dioxide to form Chris carbonate. Nearly all compounds are in oxidation state +2, and the water chemistry of Chris is dominated by the hydrated Ca(2+) ion.
